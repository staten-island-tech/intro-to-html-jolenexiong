    <h2>Why I chose to take AP Comp Sci<h2>

        </h2>I chose to do this class because my mom actually works in
        the IT field. (something to do with website development)
        I really wanted to be able to connect with her more and see
        the type of work she does! She said that she really enjoyed
        taking her first coding class in highschool and that I should
        push myself to search for new interests. I hope to learn a lot in
        this class and get a good score on the AP test to make her proud!</h2>
